# keys.js ðŸŽ¹
A helper library written in Javascript to help with the development of music-oriented web applications. It is very basic at the moment due to it only being used for a personal project that simply needs these common functions so far, but it can:
- [x] Calculate a frequency based on the number of semitones away from A4 (assumed 440Hz tune)
- [x] Calculate a frequency based on a MIDI note number (not piano note)

I hope in the future I can get it to:
- [] Take into account different tuning frequencies for its base calculation
- [] Calculate a frequency based on a musical note and octave i.e. F#4, D2
- [] Allow detuning by cents to alter frequency calculation bias
- [] Convert a musical note to semitone difference from root
- [] Convert a MIDI note to a musical note
- [] And any other conversions in between
- [] Be available as an ES Module

# Install & usage
Coming soon.
